To run this program, a file called "Lyrics.txt" needs to be created and filled
with lyrics from any given song. Inside of the lyrics.java file, the filepath of
"Lyrics.txt" needs to be referenced to the BufferedReader. Now for the output.txt,
a path for the file needs to be assigned, if no path has been assigned it will save
to the users directory.
